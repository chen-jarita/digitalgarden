> In ==retracing== some of the steps of a journey, I am not making the same journey. I have found new things along the way because I have stayed closer to the everyday.
> Sara Ahmed, Living a Feminist Life, p.25

>This book still follows words around just as I have done before, turning a word this way and that, ==like an object that catches a different light every time it is turned;== attending to the same words across different contexts, allowing them to create ripples or new patterns like texture on a ground. I make arguments by listening for resonances; the book thus involves repeating words, sometimes over and over again; words like shatter, words like snap. The repetition is the scene of a feminist instruction.
