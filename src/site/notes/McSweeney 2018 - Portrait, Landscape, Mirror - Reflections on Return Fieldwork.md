> Some of the benefits of returning are obvious. These include the immediate familiarity of place, people, and language. There is also tremendous personal gratification in returning to work with old friends, to watch children grow whose birth I witnessed, to be able to bring gifts for a specific person or family. There is also no doubt that by returning to this particular place I accord its residents tremendous respect. I cannot count the number of times that villagers emphasized that they were delighted that I had come back. Especially after Hurricane Mitch, people told me that my return contributed to their feeling of not being “forgotten.”
