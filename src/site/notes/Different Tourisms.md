#### Seichi Junrei (Fussa, Hokkaido)

Seichi Junrei (lit. pilgrimage to sacred places) is a type of “pop culture” “contents” tourism. 

> a Japanese buzzword and internet slang term describing a form of pop-culture tourism or film tourism where fans of anime subculture-related media make visits to real-world locations featured as settings, backgrounds, or general inspiration for their favorite series.

At first glance, that may be what I did at [[Fussa (City)\|Fussa (City)]].

I visited a restaurant, where 新井さん had performed his first instrumental live and signed his name 15 years ago; the mama-san (owner) also affectionately placed a photo set of 新井さん playing with a Deme-san and the drummer of KG, as well as the Bass Magazine that featured 新井さん on the cover.

I also visited Live Bar Purpose, the setting of the MV of their song “Teenager Forever.” This bar was also featured in their MV making/behind-the-scenes video.

~~新井さん bought a car for his mom and traveled with her in Hakone, in Japan, as a thank you (~~[[Gratitude\|gratitude]]~~). In the video, he also played for his mom in this bar.~~
