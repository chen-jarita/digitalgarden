> Travelers are the visitors who really get to know a culture; they are the guests who stay for “the season”. As tourists take the place of travelers, what will become of the relationship of the locals and the people from ‘away’? Already we have a taste of the answer: indifference at best. (Carol Traynor Williams, Travel Culture: Essays on What Makes Us Go (1998), p. xxii)

> a more nuanced, yet equally reductionist distinction between “tourists”, “travelers” and “ethnographers” (cf. Galani-Moutafi 2000).

Desires for authenticity

> Related to MacCannell’s approach, literary critic Jonathan Culler distinguished between two forms of authenticity: the unexpectedness of what might be found off the beaten track, and (what MacCannell has emphasized) the authenticity a site gains from its markers (Culler 1981: 133–134).
