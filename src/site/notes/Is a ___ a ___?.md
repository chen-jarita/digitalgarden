# A hot dog might be a sandwich, and cereal might be a soup, but is a______ a______ ______?

I’ve refused the word “fieldwork” to describe what I was doing. Yes, you may think, if it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably *is* a duck. However,
even if it made what I was doing more [[legible\|legible]], I just… didn’t like it.


I wanted to resist its “observational,” “purpose-driven” “utilitarian” features. No matter how… anthropological discursive self-reflexivity, it always felt performatively academic, to appeal to a certain set of institutional conventions determined by certain people in power.

It was important to me that “fieldwork” “research” was not the purpose but the form. As I quoted and written about in my honors thesis during college:

> [Zoe Todd](https://civiclaboratory.nl/2021/01/03/collabrary-a-methodological-experiment-for-reading-with-reciprocity/):\
> Reciprocity of thinking requires us to pay attention to who else is speaking alongside us. It also positions us, first and foremost, as citizens embedded in dynamic legal orders and systems of relations that require us to work constantly and thoughtfully across the myriad systems of thinking, acting, and governance within which we find ourselves enmeshed. Before I am a scholar or a researcher, I am a citizen of the Métis Nation with duties and responsibilities to the many different nations/societies/peoples with whom I share territories. This relational approach means that my reciprocal duties to others guide every aspect of how I position myself and my work, and this relationality informs the ethics that drive how I live up to my duties to humans, animals, land, water, climate and every other aspect of the world(s) I inhabit. (2016, 19)

I resonate so strongly with this quote because while, yes, I do hope to contribute some meaningful knowledge into this world, I am driven to do this work of “research” primarily because of who I am and the web of relations I am “enmeshed” in. That’s not something that “research” can capture.

Similarly, I’m not so fond of the “travel,” let alone “[[Authenticity -'(Good) Travellers and (Bad) Tourists'"\|touris]]m” (which has its own set of connotations). Regardless of how people want to differentiate “深度旅游” and the “打卡式 tourist,” the whole authenticity debate, this sort of [[short term - duration and movement\|short-term]] moving towards an “[[elsewhere\|elsewhere]]” to briefly see and experience things, was never something I was particularly interested in doing. 

These were the feelings I had before I embarked on this project. My thinking, and hence feelings, about these concepts has since changed; they’ve been complicated. For example, what makes? Thinking about the [Anthropology and/as Travel](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25757889?seq=11).

The theme of this project, “travel” as a semi-undefined starting point, “movement” as its recursive undercurrent. Please explore, ~~follow~~, my different trails of movements in different directions: within a network of relations and feelings. (affect?), amongst different sets of knowledges, across boundaries, onto paths taken, untaken… and stopping at paths meant to be untaken.
